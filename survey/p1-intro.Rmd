# Consent form

This survey is being conducted by researchers from University of Brasilia and University of Denmark. We will not be collecting any identifying data, such as your name or address. The whole survey will take approximately 10 to 15 minutes to complete. Your participation is voluntary and you may stop the survey at any time.

If you would like to participate, please answer the following questions:

I am age 18 or older

- Yes
- No

I have read and understand the above information

- Yes
- No

---

Do you like coffee?

- Yes!
- Kind of
- No :(

How do you often buy coffee?

- As whole roasted beans
- Ground
- Capsules
- Ready-to-drink

---

Before we go on, please select the frequency you BUY coffee:

- Frequently
- Rarely

(For this example, I'm using the response here to screen out respondents - I'm only interested in people who choose "Frequently", so if you choose "Rarely" you'll be screened out. Usually you would not tell respondents ahead of time how they will be screened - I'm just putting an explanation here since this whole survey is for demonstration purposes)
